# TSF - Data Science tasks
The completed tasks are:
1. **Task 1: To Explore Supervised Machine Learning.** 
Here I created a Linear regression model from scratch and trained it on the provided dataset.  
2. **Tasks 2: To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning.**
I implemented a K-Means model to be trained on the provided dataset. The right number of clusters was also determined using the _"Elbow Method"_.
